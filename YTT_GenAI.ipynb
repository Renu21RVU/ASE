        "1) Approch:\n",
        "  - first extrct the subtitles from the video provided through the url.\n",
        "  - next we translate it.\n",
        "  - finally we implement this translation in the youtube video for testing if it actually works on any video.\n",
        "  - additionally we wanna translate the text in the video to be translated like when there is a sceen where in people are chatting. here we wanna recognise the text and translate it using text recognision model.\n",
        "  - And also we wanna create a chatbot which can answer any type of questions related to this video. we can crate this by feeding the translated text and then using genai connecting to sources with similar content. these contents can defo improve the expereince of the chatbot.\n",

Vielen Dank which means thank you thank you very much thank you very much which is not what we are expecting. it is supposed to be Danke, danke, vielen Dank. I encountered same problem with hindi. as of now i checked only with these 2 languages.  \n",

I SPENT THE LAST YEAR SHOOTING A SHOW CALLED \"THE LAST OF US\" ON HBO. FOR SOME HBO SHOES, YOU GET TO SHOOT IN A FIVE STAR ITALIAN RESORT SURROUNDED BY BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE, BUT I SAID, NO, THAT\\'S TOO EASY. I WANT TO SHOOT IN A FREEZING CANADIAN FOREST WHILE BEING CHASED AROUND BY A GUY WHOSE HEAD LOOKS LIKE A GENITAL WART. IT IS AN HONOR BEING A PART OF THESE HUGE FRANCHISEs LIKE \"GAME OF THRONES\" AND \"STAR WARS,\" BUT I\\'M STILL GETTING USED TO PEOPLE RECOGNIZING ME. THE OTHER DAY, A GUY STOPPED ME ON THE STREET AND SAYS, MY SON LOVES \"THE MANDALORIAN\" AND THE NEXT THING I KNOW, I\\'M FACE TIMING WITH A 6-YEAR-OLD WHO HAS NO IDEA WHO I AM BECAUSE MY CHARACTER WEARS A MASK THE ENTIRE SHOW. THE GUY IS LIKE, DO THE MANDO VOICE, BUT IT\\'S LIKE A BEDROOM VOICE. WITHOUT THE MASK, IT JUST SOUNDS PORNY. PEOPLE WALKING BY ON THE STREET SEE ME WHISPERING TO A 6-YEAR-OLD KID. I CAN BRING YOU IN WARM, OR I CAN BRING YOU IN COLD. EVEN THOUGH I CAME TO THE U.S. WHEN I WAS LITTLE, I WAS BORN IN CHILE, AND I HAVE 34 FIRST COUSINS WHO ARE STILL THERE. THEY\\'RE VERY PROUD OF ME. I KNOW THEY\\'RE PROUD BECAUSE THEY GIVE MY PHONE NUMBER TO EVERY PERSON THEY MEET, WHICH MEANS EVERY DAY, SOMEONE IN SANTIAGO WILL TEXT ME STUFF LIKE, CAN YOU COME TO MY WEDDING, OR CAN YOU SING MY PRIEST HAPPY BIRTHDAY, OR IS BABY YODA MEAN IN REAL LIFE. SO I HAVE TO BE LIKE NO, NO, AND HIS NAME IS GROGU. BUT MY COUSINS WEREN\\'T ALWAYS SO PROUD. EARLY IN MY CAREER, I PLAYED SMALL PARTS IN EVERY CRIME SHOW. I EVEN PLAYED TWO DIFFERENT CHARACTERS ON \"LAW AND ORDER.\" TITO CABASSA WHO LOOKED LIKE THIS. AND ONE YEAR LATER, I PLAYED REGGIE LUCKMAN WHO LOOKS LIKE THIS. AND THAT, MY FRIENDS, IS CALLED RANGE. BUT IT IS AMAZING TO BE HERE, LIKE I SAID. I WAS BORN IN CHILE, AND NINE MONTHS LATER, MY PARENTS FLED AND BROUGHT ME AND MY SISTER TO THE U.S. THEY WERE SO BRAVE, AND WITHOUT THEM, I WOULDN\\'T BE HERE IN THIS WONDERFUL COUNTRY, AND I CERTAINLY WOULDN\\'T BE STANDING HERE WITH YOU ALL TONIGHT. SO TO ALL MY FAMILY WATCHING IN CHILE, I WANT TO SAY [ SPEAKING NON-ENGLISH ] WHICH MEANS, I LOVE YOU, I MISS YOU, AND STOP GIVING OUT MY PHONE NUMBER. WE\\'VE GOT AN AMAZING SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT.

Ich habe das letzte Jahr mit dem Schießen verbrachtEine Show namens \"The Last Us\" auf HBO. Für ein paar HBO -Schuhe können Sie in einem italienischen Fünf -Sterne -Resort von schönen Menschen umgeben, aber ich sagte, nein, das ist zu einfach. Ich möchte drinnen schießen.Ein eisiger kanadischer Wald, während er von einem Mann verfolgt wird, dessen Kopf wie eine Genitalwarde aussieht. Es ist eine Ehre, Teil dieser riesigen Franchise -Unternehmen wie \"Game of Thrones\" und \"Star Wars\" zu sein, aber ich werde immer noch gebrauchtFür Leute, die mich erkennen. Neulich hat mich ein Mann auf der Straße angehalten und sagt: Mein Sohn liebt \"den Mandalorianer\" und das nächste, was ich weiß, bin ich mit einem 6-Jährigen mit dem Timing mit einem 6-Jährigen, der keine Ahnung hatWer ich bin, weil mein Charakter die gesamte Show eine Maske trägt. Der Typ ist wie, mache die Mando -Stimme, aber es wie eine Schlafzimmerstimme. Ohne die Maske klingt es einfach pornig. Leute, die auf der Straße vorbeigehenFlüsterung zu einem 6-jährigen Kind.Ich kann dich warm einbringen, oder ich kann dich kalt einbringen.Obwohl ich in den USA kam, als ich klein war, wurde ich in Chile geboren und habe 34 erste Cousins, die noch da sind.Sie sind sehr stolz auf mich.Ich weiß, dass sie stolz sind, weil sie meine Telefonnummer an jede Person geben, die sie treffen, was bedeutet, dass jemand in Santiago mir Sachen schreibt, wie, können Sie zu meiner Hochzeit kommen oder können Sie meinen Priester alles Gute zum Geburtstag singen oderIST BABY YODA im wirklichen Leben.Also muss ich wie nein sein, nein, und sein Name ist Grogu.Aber meine Cousins waren immer so stolz.Zu Beginn meiner Karriere habe ich in jeder Kriminalitätshow kleine Teile gespielt.Ich habe sogar zwei verschiedene Charaktere in \"Law and Order\" gespielt.Tito Cabassa, der so aussah.Und ein Jahr später habe ich Reggie Luckman gespielt, die so aussieht.Und das, meine Freunde, heißt Reichweite.Aber es ist erstaunlich, hier zu sein, wie ich sagte.Ich wurde in Chile geboren und neun Monate später flohen meine Eltern und brachten mich und meine Schwester in die USA. Sie waren so mutig, und ohne sie würde ich nicht hier in diesem wunderbaren Land sein, und ich würde sicherlich nicht \\ 'Ich stehe heute Abend hier mit euch allen.Für alle meine Familie, die in Chile zuschauen, möchte ich sagen, dass ich [nicht englisch spreche], ich liebe dich, ich vermisse dich und hör auf, meine Telefonnummer herauszugeben.Wir haben heute Abend eine tolle Show für Sie.Coldplay ist hier, also stach ', metadata = {' Source ':' Qsyglzkeveg ',' Titel ':' Pedro Pascal Monolog - SNL ',' Beschreibung ':' Unbekannt ',' View_count ': 1785641,' Thumbnail_url ':': ':': 'View_count': 1785641, 'Thumbnail_url': ':'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qsyglzkeveg/hq720.jpg ',' publish_date ':' 2023-02-04 00:00:00 ',' Länge ': 224,' Autor ':' Samstagabend live live'})]\n"

I KNOW THEY\\'RE PROUD BECAUSE THEY GIVE MY PHONE NUMBER TO EVERY PERSON THEY MEET, WHICH MEANS EVERY DAY, SOMEONE IN SANTIAGO WILL TEXT ME STUFF LIKE, CAN YOU COME TO MY WEDDING, OR CAN YOU SING MY PRIEST HAPPY BIRTHDAY, OR IS BABY YODA MEAN IN REAL LIFE. SO I HAVE TO BE LIKE NO, NO, AND HIS NAME IS GROGU. BUT MY COUSINS WEREN\\'T ALWAYS SO PROUD. EARLY IN MY CAREER, I PLAYED SMALL PARTS IN EVERY CRIME SHOW. I EVEN PLAYED TWO DIFFERENT CHARACTERS ON \"LAW AND ORDER.\" TITO CABASSA WHO LOOKED LIKE THIS. AND ONE YEAR LATER, I PLAYED REGGIE LUCKMAN WHO LOOKS LIKE THIS. AND THAT, MY FRIENDS, IS CALLED RANGE. BUT IT IS AMAZING TO BE HERE, LIKE I SAID. I WAS BORN IN CHILE, AND NINE MONTHS LATER, MY PARENTS FLED AND BROUGHT ME AND MY SISTER TO THE U.S. THEY WERE SO BRAVE, AND WITHOUT THEM, I WOULDN\\'T BE HERE IN THIS WONDERFUL COUNTRY, AND I CERTAINLY WOULDN\\'T BE STANDING HERE WITH YOU ALL TONIGHT. SO TO ALL MY FAMILY WATCHING IN CHILE, I WANT TO SAY [ SPEAKING NON-ENGLISH ] WHICH MEANS, I LOVE YOU, I MISS YOU, AND STOP GIVING OUT MY PHONE NUMBER. WE\\'VE GOT AN AMAZING SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT.

I SPENT THE LAST YEAR SHOOTING A SHOW CALLED \"THE LAST OF US\" ON HBO. FOR SOME HBO SHOES, YOU GET TO SHOOT IN A FIVE STAR ITALIAN RESORT SURROUNDED BY BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE, BUT I SAID, NO, THAT'S TOO EASY. I WANT TO SHOOT IN A FREEZING CANADIAN FOREST WHILE BEING CHASED AROUND BY A GUY WHOSE HEAD LOOKS LIKE A GENITAL WART. IT IS AN HONOR BEING A PART OF THESE HUGE FRANCHISEs LIKE \"GAME OF THRONES\" AND \"STAR WARS,\" BUT I'M STILL GETTING USED TO PEOPLE RECOGNIZING ME. THE OTHER DAY, A GUY STOPPED ME ON THE STREET AND SAYS, MY SON LOVES \"THE MANDALORIAN\" AND THE NEXT THING I KNOW, I'M FACE TIMING WITH A 6-YEAR-OLD WHO HAS NO IDEA WHO I AM BECAUSE MY CHARACTER WEARS A MASK THE ENTIRE SHOW. THE GUY IS LIKE, DO THE MANDO VOICE, BUT IT'S LIKE A BEDROOM VOICE. WITHOUT THE MASK, IT JUST SOUNDS PORNY. PEOPLE WALKING BY ON THE STREET SEE ME WHISPERING TO A 6-YEAR-OLD KID. I CAN BRING YOU IN WARM, OR I CAN BRING YOU IN COLD. EVEN THOUGH I CAME TO THE U.S. WHEN I WAS LITTLE, I WAS BORN IN CHILE, AND I HAVE 34 FIRST COUSINS WHO ARE STILL THERE. THEY'RE VERY PROUD OF ME.

            "女士们，先生们，佩德罗·帕斯卡（Pedro Pascal）！[欢呼和掌声] >>谢谢，谢谢。非常感谢。我很高兴来到这里。谢谢。去年，我在HBO上拍摄了一个名为“ Last我们的人”的节目。对于一些HBO鞋，您可以在一个被美丽的人包围的五星级意大利度假胜地拍摄，但是我说，不，这太容易了。我想在一个冰冻的加拿大森林中拍摄，同时被一个看起来像个生殖器疣的人追赶。这是这些巨大特许经营权的一部分，例如“权力的游戏”和“星球大战”，这是一种荣誉，但我仍然习惯了认识我的人。前几天，一个家伙在街上阻止了我说，我的儿子喜欢“曼陀罗人”，接下来我知道的是，我与一个6岁的孩子面对时机，他不知道我是谁，因为我的性格是我的角色整个演出都戴着口罩。那个家伙就像，做曼多的声音，但这就像卧室的声音。没有面具，听起来只有色情。人们在街上走来走去，看到我对一个6岁的孩子窃窃私语。我可以让您温暖，或者我可以使您感冒。即使我小时候来到美国，我还是出生在智利，还有34个仍然在那里的堂兄。他们为我感到骄傲。我知道他们很自豪，因为他们给我遇到的每个人都会给我的电话号码Yoda的意思是现实生活中的意思。所以我必须像否，不，他叫Grogu。但是我的堂兄并不总是那么自豪。在我职业生涯的早期，我在每场犯罪表演中都演奏了小部分。我什至在“法律和秩序”上扮演了两个不同的角色。蒂托·卡巴萨（Tito Cabassa）看起来像这样。一年后，我扮演了看起来像这样的雷吉·勒克曼（Reggie Luckman）。我的朋友们称之为范围。但是，就像我说的那样，来到这里真是太神奇了。我出生于智利，九个月后，我的父母逃离，把我和我的姐姐带到美国，他们是如此勇敢，没有他们，我不会在这个美好的国家，我当然不会今晚和你们一起站在这里。因此，对于我所有的家人在智利看，我想说[说非英语]，这意味着，我爱你，我想念你，不要再发出我的电话号码。今晚我们为您提供了一个了不起的表演。Coldplay在这里，所以坚持\n"
